# Playstore App Analysis and Visualization

## Project Description
This project was completed as a team effort by G.K. Jennifer, Uchanma Adeola Igbokwe, and Amul Gaurav. The goal of the project was to analyze and visualize data from the Google Playstore. It was undertaken as part of a live project organised by an organization named HiCounselor. HiCounselor is an organization that provides career acceleration by offering coaching and resources job seekers and professionals need to land their dream job.

We used Python for data cleaning, Google Bigquery and MySQL for running queries on the cleaned data. We then created a dashboard using Power BI to display the results. Additionally, we also used Microsoft Excel for data analysis and visualization.
